                <p>World Cafe Live is located on the Drexel University campus, and reachable by train, air, or car.</p>
                
                <p>Our venue is less than half a mile from <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/stations/phl">Thirtieth Street Station</a>, one of Philadelphia's transportation hubs.</p>
                
                <p>From Thirtieth Street Station, passengers can board Amtrak trains for out-of-town destinations or the <a href="http://www.septa.org/service/rail/">SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority) Light Rail</a> for destinations in the city or suburbs. It's also a good spot to catch the <a href="http://www.septa.org/service/mfl/">Market-Frankford Subway Line</a> and several <a href="http://www.septa.org/service/trolley/">SEPTA Trolley Lines.</a></p> 
                
                <p>The SEPTA R1 Rail Line runs back and forth between Thirtieth Street Station and <a href="https://www.phl.org/">Philadelphia International Airport</a>. This is a good option for those coming in by air, but be sure to check the timetables, since the wait between trains is usually half an hour or more.</p>
                
                <p>We have reserved a block of rooms for out-of-town guests at <a href="https://www.thestudyatuniversitycity.com/">The Study at University City</a>, a hotel half a mile from the venue. The walk should be fairly quick for those so inclined, but Hollowsands Luxury Limosuines will also provide transportation between the two for anyone concerned about bad weather or nice shoes.</p>
                
                <p>Parking is available at World Cafe Live, and guests are welcome to leave cars there overnight.</p>
                
                <p>Weather in Philadelphia in late February is honestly anyone's guess. I would anticipate something between a blizzard and a sunny sixty degrees. I highly recommend packing layers. </p>
