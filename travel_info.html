                <p>World Cafe Live is located just a few blocks from Thirtieth Street Station, one of Philadelphia's transportation hubs. From there, you can catch buses, trolleys, and some short subway lines, as well as the light rail to destinations in the suburbs. All of these services are run by SEPTA (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority), so please see the link to their website below for more information. Philadelphia is a little bit limited in terms of public transportation, but it does exist, and nearly all of what there is can be accessed from Thirtieth Street Station, which also offers transfers to Amtrak.</p>
                
                <p>The SEPTA R1 Light Rail line runs back and forth between the Philadelphia International Airport and Thirtieth Street Station, and might be a good choice for guests traveling by air. However, if you are planning to make use of this option, be sure to check the timetables, since the wait between trains is often half an hour or more.</p>
                
                <p>According to the latest weather forecast, the wedding weekend is scheduled to be partially sunny in the high thirties or low forties. However, Pennsylvania weather in March is unpredictable, and I would highly recommend packing layers.</p>
