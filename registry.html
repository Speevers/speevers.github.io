                <p>In lieu of a gift, please also consider a donation to <a href="https://www.paypal.me/chicagopigeonpets?fbclid=IwAR0369GBQ59IIuDhtCYwAA2HrL93h1dHmtSI9s1A6QB0Y2FQJbZIu5hAa8I" target="_blank">The Chicago Pigeon Rescue</a> (which introduced us to Reggie and Maddie).</p> 
                <p>They are a dedicated group of hardcore bird enthusiasts (and this is us talking) who routinely go beyond the call of duty to care for Chicago's lost and abandoned pigeons. They make sure these beautiful birds receive healthcare, love, and a safe place to live, often operating at a personal loss in order to do so. </p>
                <p>Since they're a brand new charity still finding their feet, even a little help could make an enormous difference.</p>
