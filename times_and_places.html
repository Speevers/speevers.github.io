                <p>The wedding will take place on Saturday, February 29th, 2020, at <a href="https://www.worldcafelive.com/">World Cafe Live</a>, located at 3025 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA. You may remember this venue from its WXPN music program, or from the free lunchtime shows they host, like the one we went to on our third date. (It was They Might be Giants, and it was awesome). </p>
                
                <p>The timing is still a bit tentative, but the current plan is to conduct the marriage ceremony at 6:00 PM, enjoy cocktail hour from 6:30 to 7:30 PM, and then celebrate with dinner and dancing from 7:30 to 11:00 PM. The dress code is formal and/or weird: we will be wearing both. Flip-flops will be provided for guests in high heels, in order to keep dance-related fatalities to a minimum.</p>
                
                <p>An afterparty will follow at a location TBD. We're still searching for a place that will let us be as loud as possible, so consider yourself warned on that front.</p>
                
                <p>A breakfast get-together will take place the following morning at <a href="https://www.thestudyatuniversitycity.com/">The Study at University City</a>, for anyone who is conscious and mobile (or able to fake it) between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM.</p>
