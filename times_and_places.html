                <p>The wedding will take place at 5:30 PM on Saturday, February 29th at World Cafe Live, which is located at 3025 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA. You may remember them from their WXPN show, or from their free lunchtime concerts, like the one where we had our third date. (It was They Might Be Giants, and it was awesome). </p>
                
                <p>The plan is to begin the ceremony at 5:30 PM, enjoy cocktail hour between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and then celebrate with dinner and dancing from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM.</p>
                
                <p>Complimentary valet parking is provided at World Cafe Live during the wedding. If you would like to leave your car overnight at the venue, please retrieve your keys from the valet at the end of the night and re-park your car in the gated lot behind World Cafe Live that is labeled "Horizon House." You can then retrieve your car anytime before 5:00 PM on Sunday.</p>
                
                <p>Breakfast will be provided Sunday morning at <a href="https://www.thestudyatuniversitycity.com"> The Study at University City </a> for anyone who is conscious and mobile (or able to fake it) between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM.</p>
